                <p>
                    In the first round, the player answers three multiple-choice questions related to 
                    Tunisian television shows and culture. <br/>
                    The player needs to get at least two out of three answers correct to advance.
                    If the player qualifies, they proceed to a more challenging round with ten additional questions covering 
                    Tunisian cultural topics. <br/>

                <p>
                The snake moves in a specified direction (up, down, left, or right), adding a new segment at the head 
                and removing the tail unless it has eaten. <br/> When food is consumed, the snake grows by keeping the tail intact,
                with new food appearing at random grid locations. <br/> 
                The game checks if the snake goes out of bounds or collides with itself, 
                ending the game in either case.
